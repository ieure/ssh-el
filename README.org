* SSH mode for Emacs

  Support for remote logins using =ssh=. This program is layered on
  top of shell.el; the code here only accounts for the variations
  needed to handle a remote process, e.g. directory tracking and the
  sending of some special characters.

* Usage

  =M-x ssh RET hostname RET=

** Completion

   Tab completion is never going to work as well as with local shells,
   but it does work. Set =ssh-directory-tracking-mode= to =’ftp=, and
   set =ssh-mode-hook= to:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(lambda ()
 (shell-dirtrack-mode t)
 (setq shell-dirtrackp nil))
#+END_SRC

   Sometimes stuff will get out of sync anyways. Hit =M-x dirs RET= to
   resync.
